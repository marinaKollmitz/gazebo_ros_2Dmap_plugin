# gazebo_ros_2Dmap_plugin
Gazebo simulator plugin to automatically generate a 2D occupancy map from the simulated world at a given certain height. 

This plugin was adapted from the [octomap plugin](https://github.com/ethz-asl/rotors_simulator/tree/master/rotors_gazebo_plugins) from ETH ZÃ¼rich.

## Usage 
Check out the plugin in your `catkin_ws` and build it with `catkin_make`.
To include the plugin, add the following line in between the `<world> </world>` tags of your Gazebo world file:

```
<plugin name='gazebo_occupancy_map' filename='libgazebo_2Dmap_plugin.so'>
    <map_resolution>0.1</map_resolution> <!-- in meters, optional, default 0.1 -->
    <map_height>0.3</map_height>         <!-- in meters, optional, default 0.3 -->
    <map_size_x>10</map_size_x>          <!-- in meters, optional, default 10 -->
    <map_size_y>10</map_size_y>          <!-- in meters, optional, default 10 -->
    <init_robot_x>0</init_robot_x>          <!-- x coordinate in meters, optional, default 0 -->
    <init_robot_y>0</init_robot_y>          <!-- y coordinate in meters, optional, default 0 -->
    <frame>map</frame>                    <!-- frame in which the msg is made -->
    <topic_name>grid_map</topic_name>       <!-- name of the topic the map should be published on -->
    <robot_clearance>0.5</robot_clearance>  <!-- area around init_robot_x/y to be force-cleared -->
</plugin>
```

To generate the map, call the `/gazebo_2Dmap_plugin/generate_map` ros service:

```
rosservice call /gazebo_2Dmap_plugin/generate_map
```

The generated map is published on the `/map2d` ros topic. 

You can use the `map_saver` node from the `map_server` package inside ros navigation to save your generated map to a .pgm and .yaml file:

```
rosrun map_server map_saver -f <mapname> /map:=/map2d
```
The last map generated with the ```/gazebo_2Dmap_plugin/generate_map``` call is saved.

## Hints

* To identify the connected free space the robot would discover during mapping, the plugin performs a wavefront exploration along the occupancy grid starting from the origin of the gazebo world coordinate system. Please ensure that the corresponding cell is in the continuous free space. 
* The plugin will map all objects in the world, including the robot. Remove all unwanted  objects before creating the map or use the robot_clearance tag whilst including the plugin to force "clear" the area with a certain radius around the position given through init_robot_x and init_robot_y
